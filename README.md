# Kolhapur Tech Tribe's Hacktoberfest 2023

This is a repository for KTT's Hacktoberfest for the year 2023.
The aim of this repository is to get _meaningful_ contributions from the community.

Any code contributions, including data structures, algorithm implementations are welcome.
You are free to choose the language of your choice.

## Guidelines
- Do **NOT** copy past the code from any source, be it a website or ChatGPT. Submissions will not be accepted.
- Try to write clean code following variable and function naming conventions for the language that you are using.
- Follow the file naming conventions, for example you are writing a binary search program in Python, your file name would look something like this: `binary_search.py` and `BinarySearch.java` in case if you are using Java. You are expected to follow it for the language that you use.
- Only meaningful contributions will be accepted, any half-baked code will not be accepted.
- Try to add a comment at the top of your file, specifying what the code does so that it becomes easy for other people to read and understand your code.

## Contributing

You will need to have a following things in order to contribute:
- GitHub account
- Git
- Language that you want to code in
- Code editor for that language

Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/harshshinde07/ktt-hacktoberfest-23.git
```
Go to the root of the repository
```sh
cd ktt-hacktoberfest-23
```

Create your new local branch
```sh
git checkout -b <YOUR BRANCH NAME>
```

Create a new file and finish coding.
Now you want to add created file, commit and push it to remote
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"
git push origin <YOUR BRANCH NAME>
```

The commit message should explain what change you have added. For exapmple, if I add a binary search code in C language, then my commit message will be- "add binary search code in C"

The branch name will be the same that you used while the `checkout` command above. Try to use your own name as a branch name, just to avoid any confusion.

Now you want to visit this code repository on GitHub, and raise a Pull request. Once the request is approved, you have successfully started your open source journey!


**Happy Contributing!**
